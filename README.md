# Exercises JavaScript
Each exercise starts with a problem description. Read this description and try to solve the exercise.  

__If you want to learn something from the exercises, I recommend looking at the solutions only after you’ve solved the exercise, or at least after you’ve attacked it long and hard enough to have a slight headache.__

Good luck!
