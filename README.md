# exercises-js
Each exercise starts with a problem description. Read this description and try to solve the exercise. If you run into problems, consider reading the hints after the exercise. 

If you want to learn something from the exercises, I recommend looking at the solutions only after you’ve solved the exercise, or at least after you’ve attacked it long and hard enough to have a slight headache.

Good luck!

## Looping a triangle

Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
```
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
```
> It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.
```
let abc = "abc";
console.log(abc.length);
// → 3
```
